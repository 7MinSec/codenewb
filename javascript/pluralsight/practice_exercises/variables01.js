var x;
// This is like going out and renting a storage locker with nothing in it

console.log(x);

// If you run this program, variable will be undefined, so the program is essentially saying 
// "you've put nothing in the variable!"
// Keep in mind "Not defined" is an error.  It means syntax is wrong.  Node is basically saying
// "You're trying to use x, I dunno what that is. So I'm stopping."
// "Not defined" is DIFFERENT than undefined.
