Welcome to Codenewb by 7 Minute Security

Uh...what's "codenewb"?
--------
It's my live notebook and practice exercises for learning Python, Powershell, C#, Javascript and other languages.  

Where are you learning this stuff?
--------
I signed up for a [Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com) account.  It's a great, affordable learning platform for a whole bunch of cool IT/security stuff (and no, they're not paying me to say this).  I also recently signed up for a [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) subscription.

Pfft! You don't know how to code?
--------
No.  I love IT and security, but have zero coding experience.  

Why are you doing this?
--------
I want to:

* Fill my coding skills gap
* Share what I'm learning with others

Who are you?
