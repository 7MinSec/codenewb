## Who are you?
Hey, I'm [Brian](https://brianjohnson.tv) and I really like [information security](https://7ms.us).  

## What are you, some kind of newbie at coding?
Yes.  The only C# I'm familiar with is one on a piano (*rimshot!*).

## What are you doing with this project?
I enrolled in a few [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) courses to learn more about coding (specifically C#, JavaScript, Powershell and Python), and thought I'd use this GitHub repository as an online notebook/journal of my progress.  

## Ha!  I bet I'm going to point, laugh and LOL at the stuff you put up here!
Go for it!

## My 2-year-old can code better than you!
Well, my dad can beat up your dad.  Nyeah-nyeah!
