# Python
This is my live notebook as I chug through some Python classes over at [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com) including:

* [Python: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-getting-started)
* [Python Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/python-fundamentals)

## Intro to Python
It's beautiful, powerful and cross-platform.  Django and Flask are Python Web frameworks.  I didn't know that :-/.  

You can also do some home automation stuff!

Python is also simple - Java takes about 6 lines to print "hello world" where Python can do the same thing in 1.

Python kinda forces you to write legible, understandable code. 

Python uses indentation (using tabs or spaces) instead of curly braces.

Python's "rules" come in the form of PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals), like PEP8 - principles to make your code more readable example:

* You need two empty lines before a new class declaration
* Function names should be all lower with underscores for spaces

(PEP8 is usually integrated in popular Python editors)

### Python 2 vs. 3?!?!?!!?!
Long and short of it?  Just use v3.  

## Installing python
On Linux, it should already be there.  If you type `python --version` you'll probably see *Python 2.7.12* and if you type `python3 --version` you'll see something like *Python 3.x.x.*

Also install *idle3* by issuing `apt-get install idle3`.  I ran into issues here because I'm using Kali, and apparently there are some unmet dependencies and blah blah blah.  A quick Google search led me to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HLbo-Jr1sE) which explained the syntax may be as simple as:

`apt-get install idle`

And indeed it was!  But that seemed to just update Python2 (I need to look into it) so I also did this for good measure:

`apt-get install idle3`
